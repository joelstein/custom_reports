THIS RELEASE
- custom report form fields
  - don't allow these to be required, but instead validate required ones in a custom callback
    - well, if they are required, it doesn't seem to cause any problem... weird!

FUTURE RELEASE
- make history page a little more intuitive
- ability to view report results in (sortable) table
  - same for those stored in history
- for stored reports, show the date and time of the last saved file
  - would be nice to show this as a #description per option... is that possible? (or in a table)
- possibly make List page a table, with the following columns:
  [] (radio) | Report Title | Last Generated (w/ link to stored page)
- consider merging with "customreports" module
